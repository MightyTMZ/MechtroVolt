MechtroVolt:

An engineering team. Mainly composed of high school and university students

Projects running from Feb 2023 to September 2023:

1. Humanoid Robot. Name? (robotic engineering)
-  Coodinator(s): Aurick Anwar --> accepting 2 more coordinators positions (application process)

2. Aquarius, the launch of a weather balloon to conduct atmospheric research (aerospace engineering)
- Coordinator(s): Bardia Hashemi, Artin Zainalpour, Tom Zhang
- MUST have amateur radio license

Aquarius marks a pioneering venture in aerospace engineering for students. It will involves the 
launch of a weather balloon equipped for cutting-edge atmospheric research. With a primary focus 
on aerospace technology, the team aims to gather valuable data to deepen our understanding of the 
Earth's atmosphere, especially the one above Canadian and North American soil. The team will also 
work together to be able to communicate with the balloon once it is in the air and will attempt 
to retrieve it once it lands back on the ground. We aim to launch it to an altitude of at least 
25-30 miles. 


3. EnviroPulse, harvesting energy for the future (electrical engineering)
- Coordinator(s): Tom Zhang, Artin Zainalpour --> accepting 1 more coordinators positions (application process)

EnviroPulse stands as an innovative venture in electrical engineering with an open opportunity for 
one more coordinator through an ongoing application process. This  project is 
dedicated to harvesting and procuring energy for the future. EnviroPulse explores cutting-edge technologies and
methods to harness sustainable energy sources. The 
team envisions a future where efficient energy harvesting techniques play a pivotal role in 
addressing the global energy challenge. For example, 

- photovoltaic cells
- small turbines, 
- thermoelectric materials
- radio-frequency harvesting
- hydroelectricity
- bioenergy

We want to make a crop irrigation system where we have:

- sensors to collect soil data (EE)
- sensors to collect atmospheric/surrounding data (EE)
- AI to analyze the trends
- drones to monitor the crops using computer vision (AE)
- sliding system with robotic nutrition replenishers (EE, RE)
- energy grid which powers electrical appliances using harvested energy (solar, wind, etc) --> (EE)
This is just the idea from Tech Hours

Put out applications for MechtroVolt and accept about 30 people to work on this amazing project. Go out into a large patch of land and 
actually plant a large area of plants and implement this idea

On top of big scale projects. We will present these projects to actual venture capitalists and see if we can 
potentially get funding for some of them. 

Contests and Hackathons: We will be also competing in contests and hackathons. For each contest, MechtroVolt will
be sending a few teams to these competitions. 

- NASA Space Apps challenge
- The Mentor's Project events
- University of Toronto events
- University of Waterloo events
- McMaster University events
- as many hackathons you can find on Major League Hacking (MLH)
